							<p>
								Maria is the Associate Development Director at a small liberal
								arts college in the Midwest. Her portfolio is foundation relations
								and stewardship of grants and donors that support programs at
								the college. She is on the lookout for new opportunities as well
								as opportunities with existing foundations.
							</p>

							<p>
								Maria’s college participates in the Schuler Scholar Program, but
								as she has been in her position for only three years, she’s not
								entirely familiar with the program or the foundation. She
								remembers reading about a new initiative about a year ago, and
								wonders if the foundation may have opportunities for her
								college.

									She wants a way to get regular updates from the foundation to know if there are new opportunities.

								John is an Associate Dean of Students and Professor of Mathematics
								at an East Coast liberal arts college. He is particularly
								interested in diversity at the college and in building community
								among students from different backgrounds.
							</p>

							<p>
								He has known quite a few Schuler Scholars over the course of
								12 years at the college and has played a significant role as
								a point person for those students and to help create a supportive
								environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								John would like to find more ways to support students from
								diverse backgrounds so that he can forward opportunities to
								his colleagues in admissions and development.

							<h3>What John tells us:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Research on first-generation college student success would be helpful in building support programming.
								</li>
								<li>
									As a motivated connector, he could be a potential conduit to other departments (advancement, college administration) with potential opportunities.
								</li>
								<li>
									He is a potential “cheerleader”: for initiatives, someone who might go on record for future initiatives.

							<p>
								Jeanne is the President of a small liberal arts college — a graduate of Smith College (B.A.  History) and Harvard University (Ph.D.  Economics) — who began her tenure at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Until now most of her transition has been dealing with the college’s response to the pandemic and assuring the continuation of the college’s wide base of support.
							</p>

							<p>
								As life begins to normalize, her focus is now on the college’s future. She read about Jack Schuler in the Chronicle of Higher Education and would like to know more about his foundation.

									Search ranking may be a factor in perception.
								</li>

								Bill is a writing contributor to Inside Higher Ed, and frequently writes stories and commentary on diversity in higher education. He’s currently writing a story about College Access programs and the success rate of students who participate in these programs. He’d like to understand the foundation’s perspective and research on the long-term success of its participants. As an alum of an HBCU, Bill’s experience was different from many Schuler Scholars and he is interested in that comparison.
